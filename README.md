### Overview
Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.
* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app displays the burger in the center of the page -- waiting to be devoured.
* Each burger in the waiting area has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger moves to the right side of the page.
* The app stores every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
* [Check out this video of an example app for a run-through of how it works](https://youtu.be/msvdn95x9OM).
